# Machine-Learning-Project
Final project for machine learning course.

This project involved analyzing Reuters jail deaths data (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-deaths/), comparing trends across several states, and training and testing predictive models. All code, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and visualization is in the "533 final.R" file. The final report, produced using R Markdown, is in the root directory.
